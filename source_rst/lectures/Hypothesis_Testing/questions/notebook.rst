###IMPORTANT NOTE: This lecture corresponds to the Hypothesis Testing
lecture, which is part of the Quantopian lecture series. This homework
expects you to rely heavily on the code presented in the corresponding
lecture. Please copy and paste regularly from that lecture when starting
to work on the problems, as trying to do them from scratch will likely
be too difficult.

When you feel comfortable with the topics presented here, see if you can
create an algorithm that qualifies for the Quantopian Contest.
Participants are evaluated on their ability to produce risk-constrained
alpha and the top 10 contest participants are awarded cash prizes on a
daily basis.

Exercise 1: Hypothesis Testing.
===============================

a. One tail test.
-----------------

Using the techniques laid out in lecture, verify if we can state that
the returns of TSLA **are greater** than 0. - Start by stating the null
and alternative hypothesis - Are we dealing with a one or two tailed
test? Why? - Calculate the mean differences, and the Z-test using the
formula provided in class. - *Recall: This is a one parameter test, use
the appropriate Z-test* - Use the stat library to calculate the
associated p value with your t statistic. - Compare your found p-value
to the set :math:`\alpha` value, and conclude.

Useful Formulas:
                

.. math::  \text{Test statistic} =  \frac{\bar{X}*\mu - \theta_0}{s*{\bar{X}}} = \frac{\bar{X}_\mu - 0}{s\sqrt{n}} 

.. code:: ipython2

    prices1 = get_pricing('TSLA', start_date = '2015-01-01', end_date = '2016-01-01', fields = 'price')
    returns_sample_tsla = prices1.pct_change()[1:]
    
    print 'Tesla return sample mean', returns_sample_tsla.mean()
    print 'Tesla return sample standard deviation', returns_sample_tsla.std()
    print 'Tesla return sample size', len(returns_sample_tsla)

Write your hypotheses here:

.. code:: ipython2

    # Testing
    
    ## Your code goes here
    
    ## Sample mean difference: 
    
    
    ## Z- Statistic: 
    
    print 't-statistic is:', test_stat
    
    ## Finding the p-value for one tail test
    
    print 'p-value is: ', p_val

b. Two tailed test.
-------------------

Using the techniques laid out in lecture, verify if we can state that
the returns of TSLA **are equal** to 0. - Start by stating the null and
alternative hypothesis - Are we dealing with a one or two tailed test?
Why? - Calculate the mean differences, and the Z-test using the formula
provided in class. - *Recall: This is a one parameter test, use the
appropriate Z-test* - Use the stat library to calculate the associated p
value with your t statistic. - Compare your found p-value to the set
:math:`\alpha` value, and conclude.

Exercise 2:
===========

a. Critical Values.
-------------------

Find the critical values associated with :math:`\alpha = 1\%, 5\%, 10\%`
and graph the rejection regions on a plot for a two tailed test.

Useful formulas:

.. math::  f = 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2} 

| In order to find the z-value associated with each f value use the
  `z-table <http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~athienit/Tables/Ztable.pdf>`__
  here.
| *You can read more about how to read
  z-tables*\ `here <http://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-find-probabilities-for-z-with-the-z-table/>`__

.. code:: ipython2

    ## Your code goes here
    
    # For alpha = 10%
    alpha = 0.1
    f =
    print 'alpha = 10%: f = ', f
    
    # For alpha = 5%
    alpha = 0.05
    f = 
    print 'alpha = 5%: f = ', f
    
    # For alpha = 1%
    alpha = 0.01
    f = 
    print 'alpha = 1%: f = ', f

.. code:: ipython2

    # Plot a standard normal distribution and mark the critical regions with shading
    x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
    norm_pdf = lambda x: (1/np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) * np.exp(-x * x / 2)
    y = norm_pdf(x)
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, sharex=True)
    ax.plot(x, y)
    
    # Value for alpha = 1%
    ax.fill_between(x, 0, y, where =  x > ## Your code goes here
                    , label = 'alpha = 10%')
    ax.fill_between(x, 0, y, where = x < ) ## Your code goes here
    
    # Value for alpha = 5%
    ax.fill_between(x, 0, y, where = x > ## Your code goes here
                    , color = 'red', label = 'alpha = 5%')
    ax.fill_between(x, 0, y, where = x < ## Your code goes here
                    , color = 'red')
    
    #Value for alpha = 10%
    ax.fill_between(x, 0, y, where = x > ## Your code goes here
                    , facecolor='green', label = 'alpha = 1%')
    ax.fill_between(x, 0, y, where = x < ## Your code goes here
                    , facecolor='green')
    
    plt.title('Rejection regions for a two-tailed hypothesis test at 90%, 95%, 99% confidence')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('p(x)')
    plt.legend();

b. Mean T-Test
--------------

| Run a T-test on the SPY returns, to determine if the mean returns is
  0.01.
| - Find the two critical values for a 90% two tailed :math:`z`-test -
  Use the formula above to run a t-test on the sample data. - Conclude
  about the test results.

.. code:: ipython2

    # Calculating Critical Values probability
    
    alpha = 0.1
    f = ## Your code goes here
    print f

.. code:: ipython2

    data = get_pricing('SPY', start_date = '2016-01-01', end_date = '2017-01-01', fields = 'price')
    returns_sample = data.pct_change()[1:]
    
    # Running the T-test.
    n = len(returns_sample)
    
    test_statistic = ## Your code goes here
    print 't test statistic: ', test_statistic

c.Â Mean p-value test
====================

Given the returns data above, use the p-value to determine the results
of the previous hypothesis test.

.. code:: ipython2

    # Running p-value test. 
    
    alpha = 0.1
    p_val = ## Your code goes here
    print 'p-value is: ', p_val

--------------

Exercise 3: Multiple Variables Tests.
=====================================

a. Hypothesis testing on Means.
-------------------------------

-  State the hypothesis tests for comparing two means
-  Find the test statistic along with the degrees of freedom for the
   following two assets. Assume variance is different (We assume XLF to
   be a safer buy than GS.
-  Use the
   `t-table <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution#Table_of_selected_values>`__
   to conclude about your hypothesis test. *Pick :math:`\alpha = 10\%`*

######Useful Formulas:

.. math::  t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{(\frac{s_p^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_p^2}{n_2})^{1/2}}

.. math::  t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2})^{1/2}}

.. math:: df = \frac{(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2})^2}{(s_1^2/n_1)^2/(n_1-1) + (s_2^2/n_2)^2/(n_2-1)}

*note: one formula for t involves equal variance, the other does not.
Use the right one given the information above*

Write your hypotheses here:

.. code:: ipython2

    # Data Collection
    alpha = 0.1
    symbol_list = ['XLF', 'MCD']
    start = '2015-01-01'
    end = '2016-01-01'
    
    pricing_sample = get_pricing(symbol_list, start_date = start, end_date = end, fields='price')
    pricing_sample.columns = map(lambda x: x.symbol, pricing_sample.columns)
    returns_sample = pricing_sample.pct_change()[1:]
    
    
    # Sample mean values
    mu_xlf, mu_gs = returns_sample.mean()
    s_xlf, s_gs = returns_sample.std()
    n_xlf = len(returns_sample['XLF'])
    n_gs = len(returns_sample['MCD'])
    
    test_statistic = ## Your code goes here
    df = ## Your code goes here
    
    print 't test statistic: ', test_statistic
    print 'Degrees of freedom (modified): ', df
    print 'p-value: ', ## Your code goes here

b. Hypothesis Testing on Variances.
-----------------------------------

-  State the hypothesis tests for comparing two means.
-  Calculate the returns and compare their variances.
-  Calculate the F-test using the variances
-  Check that both values have the same degrees of freedom.

Write your hypotheses here:

.. code:: ipython2

    # Data
    symbol_list = ['XLF', 'MCD']
    start = "2015-01-01"
    end = "2016-01-01"
    pricing_sample = get_pricing(symbol_list, start_date = start, end_date = end, fields = 'price')
    pricing_sample.columns = map(lambda x: x.symbol, pricing_sample.columns)
    returns_sample = pricing_sample.pct_change()[1:]
    
    # Take returns from above, MCD and XLF, and compare their variances
    
    ## Your code goes here
    
    print 'XLF standard deviation is: ', xlf_std_dev
    print 'MCD standard deviation is: ', mcd_std_dev
    
    # Calculate F-test with MCD.std > XLF.std
    
    ## Your code goes here
    
    print "F Test statistic: ", test_statistic
    
    #degree of freedom 
    df1 = ## Your code goes here
    df2 = ## Your code goe here
    print df1
    print df2
    
    # Calculate critical values. 
    from scipy.stats import f
    
    upper_crit_value = f.ppf(0.975, df1, df2)
    lower_crit_value = f.ppf(0.025, df1, df2)
    print 'Upper critical value at a = 0.05 with df1 = {0} and df2 = {1}: '.format(df1, df2), upper_crit_value
    print 'Lower critical value at a = 0.05 with df1 = {0} and df2 = {1}: '.format(df1, df2), lower_crit_value
